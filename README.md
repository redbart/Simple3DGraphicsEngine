# Simple3DGraphicsEngine

A small demonstration of a 3D graphics engine written in Java.

###Controls
- WASD - Move
- Control/Space - Fly Up/Down
- Q/E - Turn Left/Right
- T/G - Turn Up/Down
- F/H - Roll

###Known issues
- Faces do not stop rendering when behind the camera
- Textures warp when at an angle, or when viewed close up
- Turning with yaw or pitch when rolled doesn't work intuitively at all
